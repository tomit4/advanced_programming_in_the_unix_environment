# Advanced Programming In The Unix Environment

This repo contains exercises, examples, and projects related to my readings of
the famous book by W. Richard Stevens,
[Advanced Programming In The Unix
Environment](https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/0321637739).

**Original README:**

Read the file called DISCLAIMER.

On Freebsd, type "gmake". On other platforms, type "make" (as long as this is
gnu make).

For FAQs, updated source code, and the lost chapter, see

to sar@apuebook.com.
